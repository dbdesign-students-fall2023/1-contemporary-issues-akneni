# Which database schema is better?
In this document, I discuss two articles about the performance, scalability, and reliability of SQL vs. no-SQL databases. Note that while both of these articles will have relevant points, the most optimal type of database will depend on the specific use case and type of data being stored. 


## Article 1: [How to choose between SQL and NoSQL databases](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/databases/nosql/how-to-choose-between-sql-and-nosql-databases/)
This article weighs the pros and cons of SQL vs. no-SQL databases. The author states that sequel databases are great for structured data but are not ideal for unstructured data. It suggests that SQL databases have limitations when it comes to scalability and flexibility; largely due to the fact that SQL databases need to be vertically scaled. This can be rather limiting as a single server can only get so big. 

This article provides a mostly balanced view but has a slight bias in terms of no-SQL databases. This is largely due to the flexibility and horizontal scaling that is provided by a no-sequel database. 

## Article 2: [SQL vs. NoSQL Databases, Whatâ€¦?](https://www.carleton.edu/its/blog/sql-vs-nosql-databases-what/)
This article discusses the benefits of a SQL database, stating that they are reliable, mature, well-understood, and offer strong ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance. The author also touches on the shortcomings of no-SQL databases, such as the fact that they are generally less organized, and cannot support complex queries. The article also suggests that they may be less reliable since they are a newer innovation. 

This article is largely in favor of sequel databases. It states that SQL databases are reliable and have been the go-to solution for many years due to their reliability and organizational structure. This article also does not discuss much about the limitations of a sequel database.
